# physmod
A pseudo-physical model of resonance in an n-dimensional space

This undocumented pile of code is my attempt to simulate what
vibrations may be like in an n-dimensional space in the hopes
of eventually getting some sound out of it.

If the basic concept works, I may clean it up, but for now, it's
hack hack hack just to see if anything useful comes of it at all.
